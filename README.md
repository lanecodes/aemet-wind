# AEMET Wind

Download Spanish wind speed data from AEMET's REST API.

The project [`python-aemet`](https://github.com/pablo-moreno/python-aemet)
provides access to much more of the AEMET API than this project which focusses
only on average wind speed and direction. `python-aemet` is therefore likely
to be more useful to more people. However, I struggled work out how to use it
in my application, probably due to my my extremely limited Spanish.
